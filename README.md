# simple-image-editor
Simple image editor is made in Python 3.87 with PIL and tkinter in object oriented approach.
For demo purposes I used images from Unsplash.com. 

## A note:
Right after start it creates two txt files: recent_comp_paths.txt and recent_url_paths.txt to save visited places
All images if bigger than 1080x800 are downsized with aspect ratio when opened
